# Matrix

## Info

This is a *WIP* Osclass theme that's based on Bender 3.2.0.

## Dependencies

* [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/)
* [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/)

Once you have the dependencies installed, run the following command:

```
$> npm install
```

## Watch changes

You can compile Sass files automatically every time it's changed by executing the following command:

```
$> grunt watch:matrix
```

## Build

```
$> grunt dist
```

It generates a `.zip` file per color scheme: blue (default), red, black and purple. The `index.php` and `colors.scss` are generated from the variables in `themes.json`. The screenshots are taken from `screenshot/{color scheme}/screenshot.png`.
